You might be tempted to use git for syncing your work within your groups or between your local computer and the cloud. This is fine as long as you know what you are doing, but you are under no circumstances allowed to make your assignments publicly available. Be aware that GitHub forks of public repositories (such as this one) will always be public.

**Disclaimer:** All the files posted here are subject to being changed before their corresponding handout date. We advise you to not start working on them before it's time.
