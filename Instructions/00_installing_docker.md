# Instructions for installing Docker on your local machine
When working on the cloud, you should already have a working Docker installation, as long as you set up a compute instance as outlined in the instructions for using Google Cloud. For working on your local machine, you do however need to install Docker as outlined below.

## Dependencies
For working locally with your CPU:
* Linux / Mac, or Windows 10 Pro host environment (Note: Windows 10 Home is not included)
* Docker
On Windows, Powershell is advised as a convenient CLI environment:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/

For working locally with your GPU:
* Linux host environment (Mac / Windows not supported)
* CUDA-enabled GPU with compute capability >= 3.0 (required for CUDA 9, which is used for the course) https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
* Proprietary NVIDIA driver (CUDA will not work with open-source alternatives such as Nouveau)
* Docker >= 19.03
* NVIDIA Container Runtime https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/

## Installing Docker
We advice to install the "Docker Engine - Community" edition since we have verified that it is working fine. Other editions might work just as fine.
The following page provides links to a number of ways of obtaining Docker:
https://docs.docker.com/install/

On the menu on the left-hand-side there are links to installation instructions for different host environments (Windows / Mac / Linux). Some of these links will bring you to Docker Hub, where a Docker Hub account is needed for access.

There are however other ways to download Docker, e.g. by following the link provided in the instructions under the "Releases" section at https://docs.docker.com/install/

If you want to work locally in your GPU-enabled Linux environment, remember to install all dependencies listed above, i.e. not only Docker (>= 19.03), but also NVIDIA drivers & NVIDIA Container Runtime.

### Unable to install Docker Engine

If your computer does not meet the dependencies (i.e. a non-compatible Windows version), a legacy version called Docker Toolbox, should work.

You install it by following the instructions provided here: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

#### Enable virtualisation
Under **Step 1: Check your version** -> Point 2, it says:

> If virtualization is not enabled on your system, follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for enabling it.

This means that you should change a setting in your BIOS, which is accessible during the booting of your computer.
Usually you can enter the BIOS settings by pressing `F2` during boot.
However this might vary between computer manufacturers.

In the BIOS settings, you should look for an option to enable virtualisation.
It will be named something along the lines of VT-x, Intel VT-x, Virtualization Extensions, Intel Virtualization Technology,
and there should be an option to enable it.
Then exit the BIOS menu and let your computer resume booting.


Continue following the installation instructions. You will end up with a working Docker installation.
The installation will provide a special Docker terminal which you can use, but you can just as well use Docker from any command line tool of your choice.


<!-- Windows 10
Install: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
Test & get started: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
During installation - if asked - do not check the option "Use Windows containers instead of Linux containers"
When using docker for the first time, it might ask you to enable "Hyper-V and Container features", which you will have to do. Here is how to manually enable these features (run as administrator):

Legacy Windows - will run through Linux VM, introduces performance limitations

Do Chalmers lab computers have docker installed?
Final solution: work on cloud with CPU instance -->

## (Linux) Allow your own user to run Docker
On Linux, you need to add your user to the `docker` group before you can use Docker. On the cloud, this already setup for the `dml-host` user.
```
sudo usermod -a -G docker $(whoami)
```
After you have done this, **log out** or reboot is needed to make it effective. When logging back in, verify that you see `docker` listed when running the `groups` command.

## Test Docker Installation
To test your docker installation, make sure that the following commands run without any problems:
```
docker info
docker run hello-world
```
